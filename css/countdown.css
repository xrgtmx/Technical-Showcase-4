  The Final Countdown
  Written by Joey Tempest, Performed by Europe, Released in 1986
  
  (ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one)
  
  We're leaving together,
  But still it's farewell.
  And maybe we'll come back
  To earth, who can tell?
  I guess there is no one to blame
  We're leaving ground (leaving ground)
  Will things ever be the same again?
  
  It's the final countdown.
  The final countdown...
  
  Oh!
  
  We're heading for Venus (Venus)
  And still we stand tall
  'Cause maybe they've seen us (seen us)
  And welcome us all, yeah.
  With so many light years to go
  And things to be found (to be found)
  I'm sure that we'll all miss her so.
  
  It's the final countdown...
  The final count down [2x]
  
  The final count down
  Oh!
  
  It's the final count down
  The final count down [2x]
  
  It's the final count down
  We're leaving together
  The final count down
  We'll all miss her so.
  It's the final count down.
  
  Oh!
  It's the final count down.
